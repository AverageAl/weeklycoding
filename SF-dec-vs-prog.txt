Differences between declarative and programmatic customizations

Declarative customizations include tools that are provided within a Salesforce org.
This includes examples like the object creator in setup, automation tools like process builder and flows, and reports.
Programmatic customizations include customizations made using Apex code.
One of the most important differences between declarative and programmatic customizations is that declarative customizations are guaranteed to be maintained and updated when Salesforce updates.
This means that it is the developers responsibility to maintain functionality of programmatic customizations between Salesforce updates.
